#### Exercise 1 ####
#### Question 1 ####

# Read the fast_food_data.csv into a dataset named "fast_food". 
# Set both the `header` and `stringsAsFactors` arguments equal to TRUE. 
# Subset the data set to be named "fast_food_subset" and include columns 3, 5, 6, 10, 11. 
# Then rename those columns "type", "calories","totfat","carbs", & "sugars".

# Answer: 
```{r}


fast_food = read.csv(file = "data/fast_food_data.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
fast_food_subset = fast_food[,c(3,5,6,10,11)]
colnames(fast_food_subset) = c("type", "calories","totfat","carbs", "sugars")
head(fast_food_subset)

```

#### Question 2 ####

# Create a base plot for a scatterplot of totfat on the x axis and calories on the y axis, and save it to `ffplot1`.
# Add a scatterplot layer with color as `tomato2`.
# Enhance the scatterplot `ffplot1` with `my_ggtheme`.
# Add a regression line to the scatterplot, and save the final figure as `ffplot1`.


# Answer:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
my_ggtheme = theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 20),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 16),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 25),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 18))

ffplot1 = ggplot(data = fast_food_subset, aes(x = totfat, y = calories)) +
  geom_point(color = "tomato2") +
  my_ggtheme +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
  
ffplot1
```

#### Question 3 ####

# Load the `tidyverse` package
# Create a new subset from `fast_food`, named `fast_food_sub`, 
# Select only `Calories` and variables that end in "g.", 
# EXCLUDE variables that start with "Serving" from `fast_food`.
# Drop the rows with missing values.

# Transform `fast_food_sub` to a long dataset `fast_food_long`.
# Gather them using `key` and `value`.
# Make sure to check the data afterwards.

# Answer:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
fast_food_sub = fast_food %>% 
  select(Calories, ends_with("g."), -starts_with("Serving")) %>%
  drop_na()
  
fast_food_long = gather(data = fast_food_sub, key = "variable", value = "value")

head(fast_food_long)
```

#### Question 4 ####

# Set up data:
# Use separate `mutate` statements to achieve the following goals:
# - Convert all strings in variable to lower case
# - Use `substr` and `nchar` to remove the last "." from `variable`
# - Remove remaining "."" from variable names. The ideal variable reads "trans_fat__g" 

# Hint: use `str_replace_all`.
# Confirm the changes in `fast_food_long`.

# Answer: 
```{r}
fast_food_long = fast_food_long %>% 
  mutate(variable = str_to_lower(variable)) %>%
  mutate(variable = substr(variable, 1, nchar(variable)-1)) %>%
  mutate(variable = str_replace_all(variable,  "[.]",  "_"))

```

#### Question 5 ####

# Create a base box plot of `fast_food_long` and save it as `ffboxplot`.
# Update the aesthetics of the box plot by filling the boxplot with color, 
# but make sure a legend for color is not included in the plot.

# Answer:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ffboxplot <- ggplot(data = fast_food_long, aes(x = variable, y = value, fill = variable)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
ffboxplot
```

#### Question 6 ####

# Update `ffboxplot` by highlighting the outliers. Make them red and size 3.
# Add a title "Fast Food Data" and subtitle "Boxplot" to the plot.

# Answer:
```{r}
ffboxplot = ffboxplot +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "Red",
               outlier.size = 3)+
  labs(title = "Fast Food Data",
       subtitle = "Boxplot")
ffboxplot
```

#### Question 7 ####

# Normalize the values for all variables in `fast_food_long`.
# Remove NA's while normalizing with the maximum value.
# Create a boxplot with normalized data.
# Highlight outliers and add title and subtitle as in Question 6.

# Answer:
```{r}
fast_food_long= fast_food_long %>% group_by(variable) %>%
  mutate(norm_value = value / max(value, na.rm = TRUE))
fast_food_long

```

```{r}
ffboxplot = ggplot(data = fast_food_long,
                   aes(x = variable, y = norm_value, fill = variable)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "Red",
               outlier.size = 2) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Fast Food Data",
       subtitle = "Boxplot")

ffboxplot
```


#### Exercise 2 ####
# =================================================-

#### Question 1 ####

# Convert `fast_food_sub` into a long dataset `FF_subset_long2`
# Normalize the nutrition components.
# Explicitly exclude `Calories` from the `gather` statement.
# Use the same code used previously to:
# - Change the case of all letters to lower case
# - Remove the last character from the end of the nutrition variables
# - Replace all remaining . with _ in the variable names
# Then use the group_by & mutate statements to normalize the nutritional values, using the MEAN to normalize.
# Check the head of FF_subset_long2 to confirm you have four columns. What are those column names?

# Answer: 
```{r}
FF_subset_long2 = fast_food_sub %>% 
  gather(-Calories, key = variable, value = value) %>%
  mutate(variable = str_to_lower(variable)) %>%
  mutate(variable = substr(variable, 1, nchar(variable)-1)) %>%
  mutate(variable = str_replace_all(variable,  "[.]",  "_")) %>%
  group_by(variable) %>%
  mutate(norm_value = value / mean(value, na.rm = TRUE))

FF_subset_long2
```

#### Question 2 ####

# Create a base plot with `FF_subset_long2` and call it `base_norm_plot`.
# Make sure to use the normalized values on the x-axis and calories on the y-axis.
# Add a scatterplot layer to `base_norm_plot` with point size = 1.5 and 50% opacity. Save it as `scatter_norm`.
# Answer:
```{r}
base_norm_plot = ggplot(data = FF_subset_long2, 
                        aes(x = norm_value, y = Calories, color = variable))
scatter_norm = base_norm_plot + 
                geom_point(size=1.5, 
                           alpha=0.5)
scatter_norm
```


#### Question 3 ####

# Add a 2d geom_density layer to `scatter_norm` and save it as `scatter_norm`.
# Split the scatterplots into different facets for each variable using `facet_wrap`, displayed in 2 rows.
# Answer:
```{r}
scatter_norm = scatter_norm + 
              geom_density2d()  + 
              facet_wrap(~variable, nrow = 2)

scatter_norm
```


#### Question 4 ####

# Add a built-in theme `theme_light()` to the scatterplots.
# Remove the redundant legend.
# Finally, add title "Fast Food: Calories vs. Other variables" and, 
# subtitle "2D distribution of scaled data" to the plots.
# View the updated plot.
# Answer:
```{r}
scatter_norm = scatter_norm + theme_light() + guides(color = FALSE) +
               labs(title = "Fast Food: Calories vs. Other variables",
                    subtitle = "2D distribution of scaled data")
scatter_norm
```
